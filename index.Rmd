#### Use of *R* as a Tool for Interactive Books and Short Courses {-}

There are many great tools that have been developed to author books (e.g., Word, latex) and interactive short courses (e.g., Wordpress). However, we are using `R` as a tool for writing (books and webpages) through its **markdown** capabilities, including the package `bookdown`. The use of `R` is well known in the actuarial community - we hope that promoting its application for authoring our books and short courses will help in recruiting a broad and sustainable group of authors and other volunteers from the actuarial community.

 Here is a list of pieces of the project:

*  See the [Open Actuarial Textbooks Project Site](https://sites.google.com/a/wisc.edu/loss-data-analytics/) for more information about this project.
*  [Loss Data Analytics Landing Site](https://openacttexts.github.io/)
   *  [*Loss Data Analytics*](https://openacttexts.github.io/Loss-Data-Analytics/index.html) is an interactive, online, freely available text.
   *  [Offline versions of the *Loss Data Analytics*](https://ewfrees.github.io/Loss-Data-Analytics/DownloadOffline.html) book, in **pdf** and **epub**
   *  [Spanish version of *Loss Data Analytics*](https://openacttexts.github.io/LDASpanish/)
   *  [R Code to support *Loss Data Analytics*](https://openacttexts.github.io/LDARcode)
*  A [Style Guide](https://OpenActTexts.github.io/StyleGuideLDA/index.html) (prospective contributors should check this out)
*  [Short Course on Loss Data Analytics](https://openacttexts.github.io/LDACourse1/)
*  [Github Development Site](https://github.com/OpenActTextDev)
   *  [*Life Contingencies*](https://openacttextdev.github.io/LifeCon/), under development

#### Interactive Features {-}

This document describes interactive features of the *Open Actuarial Textbooks* project that are being developed, in process, and in the planning stages. By **interactive features**, we start with simple things like layering content (such as Show/Hide way of displaying code below) and move on from there.


<h5 style="text-align: center;"><a id="display.T:Frequency.1Intro" href="javascript:togglecode
('display.T:Frequency.2Intro','display.T:Frequency.1Intro');"><i><strong>R Code for Frequency Table</strong></i></a> </h5>
<div id="display.T:Frequency.2Intro" style="display: none">

```
Insample <- read.csv("Insample.csv", header=T,  na.strings=c("."), stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
Insample2010 <- subset(Insample, Year==2010)
table(Insample2010$Freq)
```
</div>
