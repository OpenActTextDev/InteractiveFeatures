However, we are using R as a tool for writing (books and webpages) through its markdown capabilities, including the package bookdown. The use of R is well known to the actuarial community - we hope that promoting its application for authoring our books and short courses will help in recruiting a broad and sustainable group of authors and other volunteers from the actuarial community. Here is a list of pieces of the project: See the Open Actuarial Textbooks Project Site for more information about this project. Loss Data Analytics Landing Site Loss Data Analytics is an interactive, online, freely available text. Offline versions of the Loss Data Analytics book, in pdf and epub Spanish version of Loss Data Analytics R Code to support Loss Data Analytics A Style Guide (prospective contributors should check this out) Short Course on Loss Data Analytics Github Development Site Life Contingencies, under development Interactive Features This document describes interactive features of the Open Actuarial Textbooks project that are being developed, in process, and in the planning stages. By interactive features, we start with simple things like layering content (such as Show/Hide way of displaying code below) and move on from there.

In contrast, a traditional instructor is sometimes referred to as the sage on the stage, where the teacher does most of the talking and students are passive. Proponents of active learning suggest augmenting classroom activities by talking and listening in small groups, and having students write, read, and reflect on material. A variety of classroom tools have been forwarded for engaging students including discussion of scenarios and case studies, one minute papers, shared brainstorming, and the like. For more details, see a site sponsored by the University of Minnesota that provides a list of basic active learning activities or a summary from the University of Vanderbilt. Active learning is typically used in reference to classroom activities but it can also refer to textbooks. In our implementation of Loss Data Analytics, we propose to include a number of interactive features that will allow a participant to actively explore the content, described in Section 1.2. When taken outside of the classroom, the concept of active learning promotes one of the deeper learning goals set forth by some educational leaders: The ability to learn how to learn independently. We hope that instructors will be able to use the online text so that students can discover how to monitor and direct their own work and learning. 1.2 Open Actuarial Textbooks Interactive Features On the one hand, interactive features will help keep readers engaged as they explore the text. On the other hand, more is not necessarily better. Readers can be easily overwhelmed with a plethora of options and not appreciated the pedagogic approach with too many alternatives. So, we need to be thoughtful as we introduce interactive features. Both the book and the short course are authored using the R Bookdown package and hosted on Github. This allows to readily incorporate several .html, .css, and javascripts tools to enchance the interactivity. 1.2.1 What we Have  Textbook In Loss Data Analytics, we include: Layered Content. One easy feature that we have already adopted extensively is to layer the content through the use of Show/Hide labels or text. Clicking on text that is bold, in different fonts, as well as color, allows viewers to reveal and to hide selected material. We use: Statistical (R) code available via Show/Hide labels Exercise Solutions available via Show/Hide labels Short demonstrations (snippets) of mathematics available via Show/Hide labels Online Glossary. This is a feature that viewers regularly see in websites and so will not be overwhelming. The idea is to move the cursor/mouse over selected terms/phrases and have a definition appear. This is handyconvenient to handle or use for insurance and statistical terms, as well as reminders of selected acronyms. Animated Graphs. We have also incorporated a number of animated graphs in the Simulation Chapter 6. These are coded in R - although moving (animated), they do not require user interaction. End of Section Quizzes. Another feature (not so easy to code) that we have introduced is quizzes that appear at the end of each section. These quizzes are low-level formative assessment tools; they allow viewers to check their comprehension of material that they have just read. More details on this feature appear in Section 2.2 of this summary. Exercises. One of our big challenges is to decide upon the type and extent of exercises to include. See the Section 2.1 for a discussion. 1.2.2 What we Have  Short Course In the Short Course on Loss Data Analytics, we include: Video explanation of concepts. Videos are easy to incorporate into our short course (books as well, although we have not done so). All videos are closed-captioned for accessibility. Our strategy site contains standards for video production. Interactive statistical code. As we move from a world of mathematical/probabilistic modeling to one that features data, we need to think more about how to integrate statistcal code into the pedagogy. The short course tools provided by Datacamp. See Section 3.1 for a discussion. Links to external sources. Videos are easy to incorporate into our short course (books as well, although we have not used them as actively as in the short course). The challenge is getting the right set of references and setting up a system so that links can be maintained. 1.2.3 Plans for Future Work Interactive graphs. The R package Shiny allows us to introduce interactive graphs. For an example, go to our R code site under gamma distribution fand click on the tab Varying the Scale Parameter. Part of the issue is getting volunteers to author the content. Another part is that this package requires a bit more overhead so it is not clear as to whether this gets integrated into the book or is placed in a supporting site. RDRR.IO site. See Section 3.3 for further discussion. Anaconda extensions. Very interesting. Google Colab - another possibility 1.3 Other (Non-Interactive) Features Simply to round out the discussion, we point out features that are not interactive that still help to set the book project apart as special. These include: Collaborative, international author and review teams. There a variety of points of view represented in this work, making it stronger than if authored by an individual. Offline versions of the text, via pdf and EPUB, are freely available. Translations of the work will begin shortly, focusing on a Spanish version but with a Portugese one also in the works. "],["exercises-and-quizzes.html", "Chapter 2 Exercises and Quizzes 2.1 Exercises 2.2 End of Section Quizzes", " Chapter 2 Exercises and Quizzes 2.1 Exercises 2.1.1 Incorporating Exercises into the Textbook Users expect to see exercises in a textbook. For Loss Data Analytics, we have many sources and types of exercises that we can draw upon. The issue is deciding upon the type to re-inforce the emphasis of the book. Currently, the book features almost as many different exercise types as there are authors. Some chapters have no exercises, others have an extensive amount. (See also some questions in a Future Work folder on this site.) These differing viewpoints are also reflected in the examples in the book. To illustrative, some chapters focus on mathematical/statistical developments, some on data analytic aspects, some on business content. This is the good and bad associated with a heterogenous collection of authors. We can reduce the effects of this heterogeneity by providing a large pool of exercises. Some may exist outside of the book. With a large pool of exercises, users (teachers) can draw upon the subset that reflects their area of interests. 2.1.2 Wordpress Exercises Here is a series of exercises that guide the viewer through some of the theoretical foundations of Loss Data Analytics. Each tutorial is based on one or more questions from the professional actuarial examinations  typically the Society of Actuaries short term actuarial mathematics exam that used to be known as Exam C. These exercises are coded using Wordpress. Based on Google Analytics data, this approach is popular. If we want to continue to develop this line of throught, one approach is to explore bringing these exercises into the R Bookdown environment. 2.1.2.1 Frequency Modeling Frequency Distribution Guided Tutorials 2.1.2.2 Modeling Loss Severity Severity Distribution Guided Tutorials 2.1.3 Incorporating Datacamp Exercises into the Short Course Describe short course exercises here  There are a variety of ways of learning coding procedures interactively. One option is Datacamp. In particular, they have developed an R package, Datacamp Light. This allows us to integrate this interactive approach into our authoring system. Here is a link to an online regression tutorial done using this approach. There are a few little technical details but we think these are now ironed out. This is a promising option that will help make the book special. 2.2 End of Section Quizzes The more straight-forward aspect is the inclusion of end of the section quizzes. Unlike exercises, these are designed to be low-level, formative assessment tools that a person can use to assess whether there is some comprehension of material just read. Here are two end of section quizzes from Chapter 1, just to provide a flavor. More are available in Loss Data Analytics. 2.2.1 Section 1.1 Show Quiz Solution 2.2.2 Section 1.2 Show Quiz Solution "],["code-spreadsheets-and-graphs.html", "Chapter 3 Code, Spreadsheets, and Graphs 3.1 Incorporating Code 3.2 A Few Words on Spreadsheets 3.3 More on Graphs", " Chapter 3 Code, Spreadsheets, and Graphs 3.1 Incorporating Code As the baseline, we have already remarked that R statistical code appears in the text, although it does not overwhelm readers via the Show/Hide features that we are using. It will be straight forward to also include Python code in the same fashion. We have a supporting site for statistical code that allows viewers to get more experience analyzing loss data using R.
